    <h2 class="mt-5">A Brief History of Coffee</h2>
    <p>
        Coffee has a long and fascinating history that dates back to the 9th century. Here are some key 
        historical facts about this beloved beverage:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Origin in Ethiopia:</strong> According to legend, coffee was discovered by a goat herder named Kaldi in the Ethiopian region of Kaffa. He noticed that his goats became energetic after eating the berries from a certain tree.</li>
        <li><strong>Spread to the Arab World:</strong> By the 15th century, coffee began to spread to the Arab world, where it became an integral part of social life. The first coffeehouses, known as qahveh khaneh, opened in Persia (modern-day Iran).</li>
        <li><strong>Introduction to Europe:</strong> Coffee made its way to Europe in the 17th century. Initially met with suspicion, it soon gained popularity, leading to the opening of coffeehouses across major cities like Venice, Paris, and London.</li>
        <li><strong>Coffee and the Enlightenment:</strong> Coffeehouses became centers of social interaction and intellectual discussion during the Age of Enlightenment. They were often referred to as "penny universities" because for the price of a coffee, one could engage in stimulating conversations.</li>
        <li><strong>The Coffee Plantations:</strong> By the 18th century, coffee was cultivated in various tropical regions around the world, including the Caribbean, Central and South America, and Southeast Asia. Coffee became a valuable commodity and an important part of global trade.</li>
